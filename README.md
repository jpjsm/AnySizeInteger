# AnySizeInteger

AnySizeInteger is a proof of concept library
for doing integer math with no restriction
on the size of the integer.

It's written in C#, since is the language I'm
most confortable with.
Also, since this is a proof of concept of
the algorithms, C# seems to be well suited
for prototyping.
